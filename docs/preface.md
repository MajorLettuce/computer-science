# Preface

Welcome to the introductory course on computer science!

This course is my humble attempt at organizing both my own knowledge and the
knowledge of others openly available on the Internet as a guide for the people
who are just stepping onto their path to learn computer science and programming.

The aim of this course is not to teach a specific programming language, but
rather the fundamental concepts of computer science and programming
_(not coding!)_. Through **understanding** -- not memorizing -- you will learn
the **universal** principles of how computers work and how to write computer
programs regardless of whether they are electronic or not and whether they work
with the binary numbers or some other method of representing information.

Throughout the course you will see **tags** like these
[tag:computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) that will
link to a more detailed description of the term. To avoid overwhelming you with
the wealth of new concepts and topics, I have split tags into **categories**,
each one denoted with a specific color:

[tag.fundamental:Fundamental](#) ideas are the foundation of what computer
science deals with in a broad sense.

[tag.essential:Essential](#) concepts are required in order to understand how
computers work and how to use them.

[tag.supplemental:Supplemental](#) material is not strictly required and is
provided to help build a more complete picture, allowing you to dig deeper on
your own.

Hopefully this will make learning more structured and more enjoyable for you!

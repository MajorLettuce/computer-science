# Preface

Welcome to the introductory course on programming!

This course is my humble attempt at organizing both my own knowledge and the
knowdledge of others freely available on the Internet as a guide for the people
who are just stepping onto their path to learn programming.

In order to teach basic concepts of programming I will be using
<a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python
<img class="inline-icon" src="/assets/icons/python.svg">
language</a>
since it is one of the easiest languages to start with for those without prior
knowledge in writing programs.

The aim of this course is not, however, to teach the language itself but rather
the fundamental concepts of programming _(not coding!)_ which is a much wider concept
than a mere ability to write machine-readable texts.

Sample python code snippet:

```python:editor
print('This is Python code')
```

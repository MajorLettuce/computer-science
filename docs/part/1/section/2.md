# What is Knowledge

Knowlege can be divided into two types:
- **Declarative** knowledge - knowledge of particular facts:
  `I know that 1+1 equals 2`
- **Procedural** knowledge - knowing *how* to do something:
  `I know how to calculate 1+1`

Computer science deals with the procedural knowledge, studying how to build the
machines that can make use of this type of knowledge. To this day there is no
[ultimate answer to everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42))
which not only shows the limits of our current computers, but the limits of
knowledge of the humanity as well[^1]. However for the time being we will focus
only on the practical aspects of knowledge - that is how to build machines and
write programs that are able to give answers for the questions you provide.

An example of [tag:declarative
knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge) is a table with
two columns where each question on the  left column corresponds to the fact on
the right:

| Question | Answer |
|:--------:|:------:|
| 1+1      | 2      |
| 2+1      | 3      |
| 3+1      | 4      |
|    ...   |  ...   |

[tag.fundamental:Procedural knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge),
on the other hand, provides the means  to get the answer for multiple similar
questions without memorizing all the combinations. Instead, it provides an
**algorithm** to get the answers for a set of questions by following a common
set of instructions or a mathematical formula:

$
f(x) = x + 1
$

This formula describes an *infinite* amount of answers to each corresponding
question of type `what N + 1 equals to?`. It can be said that the procedural
knowledge was encoded in the equation above.

Any somewhat complex computer program includes procedural knowledge in one way
or another. That procedural knowledge is encoded as an [tag.essential:algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

[tag.supplemental:Theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation)
is the branch that deals with what problems can be solved using an algorithm and
tries to answer the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and
limitations of computers?".

>   2) Conditional statements

    This topic goes well beyond computer science and thus I will have to stop
    here, for it is possible to talk about the concepts of knowledge, information
    and their connection to the human mind for a long time on a cozy evening with
    friend at a warm cup of tea, but it deters from the aim of this course.

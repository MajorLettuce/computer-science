# Formal Logic

[tag.supplemental:Propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)
is one of the [systems of formal
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Systems_of_formal_logic). It replaces
all words with symbols that represent `variables` and `operators` making it
possible to deal with any logical statement as with an ordinary mathematical
formula.

[Introduction to Logical Symbols](youtube://kVbTXla7dQc)

A proposition is any statement that can be either `true` or `false`. In order to
symbolize a proposition all statements and connectors must be symbolized.

## Symbolizing Statements

Statements can be either **simple**:
- Dogs are mammals
- Kato is a beautiful dog
- It's raining outside

Or **complex** (compound):
- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside

Any statement can be represented as a symbol (a *variable*):
- Dogs are mammals => $D$
- Cats are mammals => $C$
- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals => $D$ `and` $C$


- It's raining outside => $R$
- I will not go outside => $I$
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside => `If` $R$ `then` $I$

## Symbolizing Operators

In total there are 5 logical operators:

[tag.fundamental:Negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation) - "it is not the case
that".
Can be represented as: `~P`, $\neg P$, $\overline {P}$.

This operator **negates** the meaning of a statement (if it was `true`, then it
becomes `false` and vice-versa).

---

[tag.fundamental:Conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) - "and".
Can be represented as: `P and Q`, `P && Q`, $P \land Q$, $P \cdot Q$.

This operator asserts that **both statements are `true`**.

---

[tag.fundamental:Disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) - "or".
Can be represented as: `P or Q`, `P || Q`, $P \lor Q$.

This operator asserts that **at least one statement is `true`**.

---

[tag.essential:Implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional) - "if
`P`, then `Q`".
Can be represented as: `if P then Q`, $P \supset Q$, $P \rightarrow Q$.

**NOTE**: While trying to understand this operator, beware of [its
paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes_of_material_implication).

**NOTE**: In cases when `P` is `false` the result of this operator is always `true` since
these are the cases of [tag:vacuous
truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth).

---

[tag.essential:Equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) - "`P`
if and only if `Q`".
Can be represented as: `P == Q`, $P \equiv Q$, $P \leftrightarrow Q$.

The truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the
other (i.e. either both statements are `true`, or both are `false`).

## Logical Formulas

After we have symbolized both **statements** and **operators** we can rewrite
propositions as formulas:

- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals => $D$ `and` $C$ => $D \land C$
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside => `If` $R$ `then` $I$
  => $R \rightarrow I$

The last proposition can be redefined as follows (notice the negation of the
second statement):
- It's raining outside => $R$
- I will go outside => $I$
- $R \rightarrow \neg I$

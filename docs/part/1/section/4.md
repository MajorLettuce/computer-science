# Formal Logic

[tag.supplemental:Propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)
is one of the [systems of formal
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Systems_of_formal_logic). It replaces
all words with symbols that represent `variables` and `operators` making it
possible to deal with any logical statement as with an ordinary mathematical
formula.

[Introduction to Logical Symbols](youtube://kVbTXla7dQc)

A proposition is any statement that can be either `true` or `false`. In order to
symbolize a proposition all statements and connectors must be symbolized.

## Symbolizing Statements

Statements can be either **simple**:
- Dogs are mammals
- Kato is a beautiful dog
- It's raining outside

Or **complex** (compound):
- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside

Any statement can be represented as a symbol (a *variable*):
- Dogs are mammals = $D$
- Cats are mammals = $C$
- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals = $D$ `and` $C$


- It's raining outside = $R$
- I will not go outside = $I$
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside = `If` $R$ `then` $I$

## Symbolizing Operators

In total there are 5 logical operators:

[tag.fundamental:Negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation) -- "it is not the case
that".
Can be represented as: `~P`, $\neg P$, $\overline {P}$.

This operator **negates** the meaning of a statement (if it was `true`, then it
becomes `false` and vice-versa):

- It's raining outside = $R$
- It's `not` raining outside = $\neg R$

---

[tag.fundamental:Conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) -- "and".
Can be represented as: `P and Q`, `P && Q`, $P \land Q$, $P \cdot Q$, $PQ$ (no
operator at all).

This operator asserts that **both statements are `true`**.

- Dogs are mammals = $D$
- Cats are mammals = $C$
- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals = $D$ `and` $C$

---

[tag.fundamental:Disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) -- "or".
Can be represented as: `P or Q`, `P || Q`, $P \lor Q$.

This operator asserts that **at least one statement is `true`**.

- I will go to the cinema = $C$
- I will go to the zoo = $Z$
- I will `either` go to the cinema `or` to the zoo = $C$ `or` $Z$

---

[tag.essential:Implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional) -- "if
`P`, then `Q`".
Can be represented as: `if P then Q`, $P \supset Q$, $P \rightarrow Q$.

This operator is `true` **unless** $P$ is `true` and $Q$ is `false`.

- It's sunny = $S$
- I will go outside = $I$
- `If` it's sunny, `then` I will go outside = `If` $S$ `then` $I$

|  $S$  |  $I$  | $S \rightarrow I$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---------------: |
| False | False |       True        |
| False | True  |       True        |
| True  | False |       False       |
| True  | True  |       True        |

<style>
    .table-wrapper:nth-child(33) table tbody tr:not(:nth-of-type(3)) {
        border-right: 2px solid var(--primary-color);
    }
</style>

The statement is `false` only in one case (when the
[tag:antecedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_(logic))
is `true`, but the
[tag:consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent)
is `false`). For the above example we
[tag:don't care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t-care_term)
whether they will go outside ($I$) or not ($\neg I$) if it is `not` sunny
($\neg S$).

> **NOTE**: While trying to understand this operator, beware of
> [its paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes_of_material_implication)
> and that you cannot directly map implication to the logic we use in our daily
> life. Because of this mismatch between our intuition and the behavior of this
> operation it is erroneous to provide examples for it in natural language.

---

[tag.essential:Equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) -- "`P`
if and only if `Q`".
Can be represented as: `P == Q`, $P \equiv Q$, $P \leftrightarrow Q$.

The truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the
other (i.e. either both statements are `true`, or both are `false`).

- It's sunny = $S$
- I will go outside = $I$
- `If only` it's sunny, `then` I will go outside = `If only` $S$ `then`
  $I$

|  $S$  |  $I$  | $S \equiv I$ |
| :---: | :---: | :----------: |
| False | False |     True     |
| False | True  |    False     |
| True  | False |    False     |
| True  | True  |     True     |

<style>
    .table-wrapper:nth-child(41) table tbody tr:first-of-type,
    .table-wrapper:nth-child(41) table tbody tr:last-of-type {
        border-right: 2px solid var(--primary-color);
    }

    .table-wrapper:nth-child(41) table tbody tr:nth-of-type(2) {
        border: 2px solid var(--primary-complementary-color);
        border-bottom: none;
    }

    .table-wrapper:nth-child(41) table tbody tr:nth-of-type(3) {
        border: 2px solid var(--primary-complementary-color);
        border-top: none;
    }
</style>

Compared to the implication, equivalence does not allow the case when the
[tag:antecedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_(logic))
is `false`, and the
[tag:consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent)
is `true`, but only the cases when both of them either `false` or `true`.

## Logical Formulas

After we have symbolized both **statements** and **operators** we can rewrite
propositions as formulas:

- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals = $D$ `and` $C$ = $D \land C$
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside = `If` $R$ `then` $I$
  = $R \rightarrow I$

The last proposition can be redefined as follows (notice the negation of the
second statement):
- It's raining outside = $R$
- I will go outside = $I$
- $R \rightarrow \neg I$

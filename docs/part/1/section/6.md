# What is Information

[tag.fundamental:Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) in
general sense can be thought of as the *knowledge about something*, regardless
of the physical media that is used to convey that knowledge. Even though we use
the term "information" frequently in our daily lives and rely upon it - to this
day there is no one specific definition of what information is.

There are multiple ways in which we can use information and interact with it:

- We can
[tag:communicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)
information to each other by using some
[tag:media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication))
such as:
writing, speaking, making gestures and showing
[tag.fundamental:signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal).
- We can
[tag:encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code)
information into
[tag.fundamental:symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol)
in order to
[tag:store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage)
and
[tag:process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_processing)
it.

Therefore it is important to distinguish `information` from `data` - the
physical or abstract manifestation of information in the *form* of **signals**
or **symbols**.

<!-- Computers can only work with data (which is a representation of
information), not the information itself. -->

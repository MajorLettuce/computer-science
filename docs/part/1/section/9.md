Passing messages by signalling over distance goes as far as to the ancient
times. One of the oldest examples is the signal towers of the Great Wall of
China. In 400 BC, signals could be sent by beacon fires or drum beats. By 200 BC
complex flag signalling had developed, and by the Han dynasty (200 BC–220 AD)
signallers had a choice of lights, flags, or gunshots to send signals.

At the core of all of those signals was a **coding** strategy -- some set of
rules that both sides agreed upon in order to communicate. But the idea of
encoding *meaning* and sending it as a **signal** was realized even earlier --
probably since the first controlled use of fire many of years ago.

[tag:Telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy)
is the long-distance transmission of messages where the sender uses symbolic
codes, known to the recipient, rather than a physical exchange of an object
bearing the message[^2].

## Polybius square

[tag:Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius#Cryptography) was a Greek
historian who came up with a numeral system called
[tag:Polybius square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square)
that allowed to encode letters of an alphabet using symbols (originally they
were groups of torches) for transferring the message over distance.
This can be concidered one of the first encodings used for

Useful for [tag:telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy).

signal torches give ability to **convey** information

message space (total number of possible messages)

symbols allow to show an arbitrary number of differences

combining symbols with multiple differences it is possible to convey more
messages

## Binary Code

you can describe a message as a combination of several (yes/no) questions

given $n$ (yes/no) questions there are $2^n$ possible answers from a **decision
tree**

### Bacon's Cipher

Francis Bacon came up with a way to convey **all** letters of the alphabet using
a **single** difference with his bi-literal cipher

> "The transposition of two letters by five placings will be sufficient for 32
> differences. For by this art, a way is opened whereby a man may express and
> signify the intentions of his mind -- at any distance of place -- with objects
> which are capable of a two-fold difference only."

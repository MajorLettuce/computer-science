# Signals and Symbols

We can **percieve** information through **signals**, but what is a signal?
A
[tag:sound wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound)
when you clap your hands produces an
[tag.fa/volume-up:audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal)
signal.
A series of changing
[tag.fa/image:images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image)
that we call
[tag.fa/film:video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video)
is a
[tag.fa/eye:visual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception)
signal.

If you write down a
[tag.fa/font:letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(alphabet))
on a piece of paper you can agree that it is a symbol for which both of us would
know the meaning (i.e. produce a specific sound). However, the idea of symbols
goes much further than letters and sounds they represent. You can attach **any**
meaning to a symbol as long as both of us (the *source* and the *reciever*) know
what that symbol represents.

This core idea is what made it possible for us to invent the languages we speak
and write. The numerous
[tag:sign systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_system)
that we use daily such as traffic lights and road signs, body language, gestures
and tone of our voice allow us to communicate, to **convey** information.

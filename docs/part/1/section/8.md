# What is Code

[tag:Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code)
is a system of rules to convert signals into another form for communication
through a
[tag:transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium)
or storage in a
[tag:storage medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage).
The process of **encoding** (*verb*) converts information from a source into
symbols for communication or storage. **Decoding** is the reverse process,
converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands[^1].

The process of **associating** information *(knowledge about something)*
to **symbol** is called **coding**.

In fact, anytime you speak to someone you encode your **thoughts** into spoken
language (i.e. English). In this case the language you use is the **encoding**
(*noun*) that is used to transfer information. Since both of you can speak
the same language you are able to understand each other.

Now suppose you want to say something to a friend in a very **noisy** area (i.e.
a rock concert). In this case you cannot speak to a person, since they won't be
able to hear you, however you still can **communicate** with each other by
showing gestures with your hands. You can encode the **same information** in a
different way.

> You can create different ways of sending `signals` to overcome the `noise`.

Usually there is a finite number of possible messages you can encode. In this
case we call it a `discrete source` of information -- each item of information
(message) is separate from one another.

Taking an example of encoding a number from a dice roll -- there are multiple
combinations on how you can roll the each die, but the amount of such
combinations is finite. Therefore it is a discrete source.

For each result of a dice roll you can designate a separate
[tag.fundamental:symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol)
that corresponds to a number that has been rolled.
Symbols can be anything that make it possible to distinguish them from one
another, for example -- *different number of plucks on the wire can represent
different symbols*.

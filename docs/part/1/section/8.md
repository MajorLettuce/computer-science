# Encoding Information

## What is Coding

[tag:Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code)
is a system of rules to convert signals into another form for communication
through a
[tag:transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium)
or storage in a
[tag:storage medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage).
The process of **encoding** converts information from a source into symbols for
communication or storage. **Decoding** is the reverse process, converting code
symbols back into a form that the recipient understands[^1].

Signal vs noise

Discrete source

You can think of each pluck as a **signal**

Multiple plucks one after another is a **symbol** that conveys the meaning -
number on the die

## Encoding Messages

[Information Theory part 4: Semaphores & signal fires](youtube://WrNDeYjcCJA)

belief state

the presence or absence of something allows to communicate **state**

signal torches give ability to **convey** information

message space (total number of possible messages)

symbols allow to show an arbitrary number of differences

combining symbols with multiple differences it is possible to convey more
messages

you can describe a message as a combination of several (yes/no) questions

given $n$ (yes/no) questions there are $2^n$ possible answers from a **decision
tree**

## Bacon's Cipher

Francis Bacon came up with a way to convey **all** letters of the alphabet using
a **single** difference with his bi-literal cipher

> "The transposition of two letters by five placings will be sufficient for 32
> differences. For by this art, a way is opened whereby a man may express and
> signify the intentions of his mind -- at any distance of place -- with objects
> which are capable of a two-fold difference only."

[tag.essential:Numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system)
is a mathematical notation for expressing numbers using symbols (usually
digits).
While there are
[many numeral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numeral_systems)
that were invented throughout the ages, the most common numeral system that most
of us use on the daily basis is
[tag:decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) (also called `base-10`).
It is a
[tag.fundamental:positional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation)
numeral system which means that the **position** of each digit in a number
affects its value differently.

## Representing Numbers

### Decimal

Consider you had a number `231`. You could express it as follows:

|       2        |       |       3       |       |      1       |
| :------------: | :---: | :-----------: | :---: | :----------: |
| $2 \times 100$ |  $+$  | $3 \times 10$ |  $+$  | $1 \times 1$ |

You can rewrite `ones`, `tens` and `hundreds` as
[tag:powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation)
of the numeral system base (in this case -- 10), where each power corresponds to
the **position** of the letter, counting from *right* to *left* and starting
with zero:

|        2        |       |        3        |       |        1        |
| :-------------: | :---: | :-------------: | :---: | :-------------: |
| $2 \times 10^2$ |  $+$  | $3 \times 10^1$ |  $+$  | $1 \times 10^0$ |

The number of possible digits in front of the positional multipler is what makes
each system special. For `base-10` you have 10 digits: `0`, `1`, `2`, ... `9`.

### Binary

While in binary numeral system (called `base-2`) we use only two digits: `0` and
`1`. Using the same method we used above we can express the same number in
binary format. We could *guess* or calculate in our head what the result should
be, or we could use a generic way to convert a number to a differnt base.

### Adding Numbers

So now that you know how to express the numbers using numeral systems with
different bases, let's tackle the general approach for adding them.

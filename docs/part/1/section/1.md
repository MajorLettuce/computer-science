# What is Computer Science

Nowadays we are surrounded with computing machines: from offloading
time-consuming computations to calculators, to relying our lives upon the the
programs that run inside cars we drive and airplanes we fly. However, it was not
always like that. First machines that were able to do computations were not even
electrical, but mechanical! Throught centuries matematicians and engineers were
obsessed with the idea of building a [tag.fundamental:universal
machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine) that could
calculate anything that humans can, but [much faster and at a greater
scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer).

And although the tasks these machines do are of great variety, the principles
that lie in the way computers accomplish these tasks are fundamentally simple.
**Computer science** as a field is very broad and can be divided into two
categories:
- **Theoretical** study of
  [tag:algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm),
  [tag:computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation) and the
  underlying entity that is at the core of both of those -
  [tag.fundamental:information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information)
- **Practical** approaches to implementing computing devices in
  [tag:hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture)[^1] and
  [tag:software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)

> **Key takeaways**
>
> - Computer science is the science of computation.
> - First computers were highly specialized and could do only one task.
> - The power of universal computer is in the instructions it follows, not it's
>   physical form.

    The field of **computer engineering** develops and studies the ways of _how_
    to build physical computers, utilizing the core concepts from computer
    science while **computer science** deals with the fundamental principles
    of computational machines and computation itself.

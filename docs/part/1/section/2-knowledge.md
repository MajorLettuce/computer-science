# Types of Knowledge

There are two types of knowledge:
- **Declarative** knowledge - knowledge of particular facts:
  `I know that 1+1 equals 2`
- **Procedural** knowledge - knowing *how* to do something:
  `I know how to calculate 1+1`

Computer science deals with the procedural knowledge, studying how to build the
machines that can make use of this type of knowledge. To this day there is no an
[tag:ultimate answer to everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)
which not only shows the limits of our current computers, but the limits of
knowledge of the humanity as well[^1]. Thus for the time being we will focus
only on the practical aspects of knowledge, not the philosophical ones.

<!-- (even though it is of great importance to keep your mind open in this regard). -->

[Declarative vs. procedural knowledge (Turing test)](youtube://QxZFKN9OEpY)

An example of [tag:declarative
knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge) is a table with
two columns where each question on the  left column corresponds to the fact on
the right:

| Question | Answer |
|:--------:|:------:|
| 1+1      | 2      |
| 2+1      | 3      |
| 3+1      | 4      |
|    ...   |  ...   |

[tag.fundamental:Procedural knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge),
on the other hand, provides the means  to get the answer for multiple similar
questions without memorizing all the combinations. Instead, it provides an
[tag.essential:algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) to get the
answers for a set of questions by following a common set of instructions or a
mathematical forumla:

$
f(x) = x + 1
$

[^1]: This topic goes well beyond computer science and thus I will have to stop
here, for it is possible to talk about the concepts of knowledge, information
and their connection to the human mind  for a long time on a cozy evening with
friend at a warm cup of tea.

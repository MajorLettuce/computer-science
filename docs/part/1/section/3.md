# What is Logic

## Logical Reasoning

Logic is at the core of any computing machine. It is what allows it to "think" -
to make decisions during the performance of an algorithm and to do the actions
themselves in an algorithm. It allows it to do computation.

[tag:Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason) is the process of going
from question to an answer and it is at the root of logic.
[tag:Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) laid the foundations of
logic by trying to come up with a
[tag:general approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)
to think about something as `true` or `false` without connecting  it the
physical form. Thinking about things in this way is called
[tag.fundamental:abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)).

Words or symbols (i.e. glyphs or numbers) act the bridge between **physical**
things and **abstract** concepts. Each symbol describes some
[tag:category](https://www.britannica.com/topic/category-logic) of objects. For
instance, a word `tree` describes all **physical** trees that exist in the
world, while a number `2` descibes an **abstract** concept of the existance of
multiple things of the same category (i.e. there are 2 trees).

Aristotle proposed an approach that allows creating relations between categories
in the form of statements `ALL [category 1] IS [category 2]`. Any such statement
could be either `TRUE` or `FALSE` but not both at the same time.
Then these statements could be further combined using **logical operators** such
as `AND` and `OR` to create a chain of reasoning, for example:

```
IF
    ALL [GREEK] ARE (HUMAN)    \
AND        ^-----------v        ) - Premise of an argument
    ALL (HUMAN) ARE {MORTAL}   /
THEN                   v
    ALL [GREEK] ARE {MORTAL}      - Logical conclusion
```

In the above example a pattern emerges: braces `( )` include a common category
between two statements - this category is called a **middle term**. The category
in the curly braces `{ }` is the final category we want to compare the first
statement to.

Aristotle pioneered the idea that we must look only at the structure of the
words, not the content of the words. Furthermore, the words themselves can be
replaced with some other symbols (i.e. glyphs or numbers) without changing the
**logical meaning**.

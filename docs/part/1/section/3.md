# What is Logic

## Logical Reasoning

Logic is at the core of any computing machine. It is what allows it to "think" -
to make decisions during the performance of an algorithm and to do the actions
themselves in an algorithm. It allows it to do computation.

[What is Logic?](youtube://xP0q3WOBRks)

[tag:Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason) is the process of going
from question to an answer and it is at the root of logic.
[tag:Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) laid the foundations of
logic by trying to come up with a
[tag:general approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)
to think about something as `true` or `false` without connecting  it the
physical form. Thinking about things in this way is called
[tag.fundamental:abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)).

Words or symbols (i.e. glyphs or numbers) act the bridge between **physical**
things and **abstract** concepts. Each symbol describes some
[tag:category](https://www.britannica.com/topic/category-logic) of objects. For
instance, a word `tree` describes all **physical** trees that exist in the
world, while a number `2` descibes an **abstract** concept of the existance of
multiple things of the same category (i.e. there are 2 trees).

Aristotle proposed an approach that allows creating relations between categories
in the form of statements `ALL [category 1] IS [category 2]`. Any such statement
could be either `TRUE` or `FALSE` but not both at the same time.
Then these statements could be further combined using **logical operators** such
as `AND` and `OR` to create a chain of reasoning, for example:

```
IF
    ALL [GREEK] ARE (HUMAN)    \
AND        ^-----------v        ) - Premise of an argument
    ALL (HUMAN) ARE {MORTAL}   /
THEN                   v
    ALL [GREEK] ARE {MORTAL}      - Logical conclusion
```

In the above example a pattern emerges: braces `( )` include a common category
between two statements - this category is called a **middle term**. The category
in the curly braces `{ }` is the final category we want to compare the first
statement to.

Aristotle pioneered the idea that we must look only at the structure of the
words, not the content of the words. Furthermore, the words themselves can be
replaced with some other symbols (i.e. glyphs or numbers) without changing the
**logical meaning**.

## Symbolic logic

[tag.supplemental:Propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)
is one of the [systems of formal
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Systems_of_formal_logic)
and replaces all words with symbols that represent `variables` and `operators`
making it possible to deal with any logical statement as with an ordinary
mathematical formula.

[Introduction to Logical Symbols](youtube://kVbTXla7dQc)

A proposition is any statement that can be either `true` or `false`. In order to
symbolize a proposition all statements and connectors must be symbolized.

### Symbolizing Statements

Statements can be either **simple**:
- Dogs are mammals
- Kato is a beautiful dog
- It's raining outside

Or **complex** (compound):
- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside

Any statement can be represented as a symbol (a *variable*):
- Dogs are mammals => $D$
- Cats are mammals => $C$
- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals => $D$ `and` $C$


- It's raining outside => $R$
- I will not go outside => $I$
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside => `If` $R$ `then` $I$

### Logical Operators

In total there are 5 logical operators:

[tag.fundamental:Negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation) - "it is not the case
that".
Can be represented as: `~P`, $\neg P$, $\overline {P}$.

This operator **negates** the meaning of a statement (if it was `true`, then it
becomes `false` and vice-versa).

---

[tag.fundamental:Conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) - "and".
Can be represented as: `P and Q`, `P && Q`, $P \land Q$, $P \cdot Q$.

This operator asserts that **both statements are `true`**.

---

[tag.fundamental:Disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) - "or".
Can be represented as: `P or Q`, `P || Q`, $P \lor Q$.

This operator asserts that **at least one statement is `true`**.

---

[tag.essential:Implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional) - "if
`P`, then `Q`".
Can be represented as: `if P then Q`, $P \supset Q$, $P \rightarrow Q$.

**NOTE**: While trying to understand this operator, beware of [its
paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes_of_material_implication).

**NOTE**: In cases when `P` is `false` the result of this operator is always `true` since
these are the cases of [tag:vacuous
truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth).

---

[tag.essential:Equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) - "`P`
if and only if `Q`".
Can be represented as: `P == Q`, $P \equiv Q$, $P \leftrightarrow Q$.

The truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the
other (i.e. either both statements are `true`, or both are `false`).

### Symbolized Propositions

After we have symbolized both **statements** and **operators** we can rewrite
propositions as formulas:

- Dogs are mammals `and` cats are mammals => $D$ `and` $C$ => $D \land C$
- `If` it's raining outside, `then` I will not go outside => `If` $R$ `then` $I$
  => $R \rightarrow I$

The last proposition can be redefined as follows (notice the negation of the
second statement):
- It's raining outside => $R$
- I will go outside => $I$
- $R \rightarrow \neg I$
